# Brew

### What is this?
This is a project to allow me to explore and practice various full-stack web development technical skills. Originally started during Boot Camp as a full-stack application to improve my skills working on front-end development with React and Redux, while consuming an external API.

### What does it use
While previously a full-stack application, Brew is now 'server-less' and uses Supabase for Authentication, Database, and Row Level Security policies for authorisation. Front-end hosting is on Render's free tier, which auto deploys from the main branch here on GitHub.

### Where can I view this?
When it is working (and when it's not), this project can be found here: [Brew!](https://brew.onrender.com/)
